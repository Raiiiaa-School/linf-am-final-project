## Project Overview

Elemental Chain Runner is a fast-paced, side-scrolling action game being developed as a 1.5-month school project. The game features:

- Elemental combat system with ability chaining
- Action-based energy absorption mechanics
- Node-based game engine architecture (inspired by Godot)
- HTML5 Canvas-based rendering
- TypeScript/JavaScript implementation

The project is structured using a modern web development stack with Webpack for bundling and TypeScript for type safety.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Prerequisites**

    - Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
    - npm (comes with Node.js)

2. **Installation**

    ```bash
    # Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/RaiiaaGithub/linf-am-final-project.git

    # Navigate to project directory
    cd linf-am-final-project

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

3. **Running the Project**

    ```bash
    # Start development server
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the game in your default browser at `http://localhost:8080`

4. **Building for Production**
    ```bash
    # Create production build
    npm run build
    ```
    This will create an optimized build in the `dist` directory.

The development server includes hot reloading, so any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the browser.

Note: The project is currently in development according to the phases outlined in the roadmap, so some features might be under construction depending on the current development phase.
